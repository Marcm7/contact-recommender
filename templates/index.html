      This app stores a list of real-world medical contacts and will later recommend
      the best match based on city, specialty, fee, and rating — ready to be deployed
      on Azure as part of your EECE439 project.

      <h3>1. Manage contacts</h3>
      <p>
        Add doctors with their city, specialty, consultation fees, and ratings.
        Later we’ll connect this to a public dataset so your list is populated automatically.

      <h3>2. Build a recommendation engine</h3>
      <p>
        The next phase is a smart search that filters by constraints like
        “surgeons in Beirut with fees under $2000 and high ratings”.

      <h3>3. Deploy on Azure</h3>
      <p>
        Finally, the whole app will be pushed to GitHub and deployed as an Azure Web App,
        satisfying the course requirements.
